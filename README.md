This simple application has 2 tables "users" and "friends" which are associated one to many. A user creates an account and then makes more friends, and each logged-in user sees only his friends. For the login and sign-in  I used Devise gem where I added a field called roles.
I used bootstrap in my pages. I used Postgresql.
